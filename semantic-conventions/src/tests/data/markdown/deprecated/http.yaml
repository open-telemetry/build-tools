            Full HTTP request URL in the form `scheme://host[:port]/path?query[#fragment]`.
            Usually the fragment is not transmitted over HTTP, but if it is known, it should be included nevertheless.

            The primary server name of the matched virtual host.
            If this attribute can be obtained, this attribute MUST NOT be set ( `net.host.name` should be used instead).
        note: >
            http.url is usually not readily available on the server side but would have to be assembled in a cumbersome and
            sometimes lossy process from other information (see e.g. open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python/pull/148).
            It is thus preferred to supply the raw data that is available.
        examples: ['example.com']
