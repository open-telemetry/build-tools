| `http.host` | string | The value of the [HTTP host header](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.4). When the header is empty or not present, this attribute should be the same. | `www.example.org` | `Recommended` | Experimental |

**[1]:** This is an example

- of note
- with list

**[2]:** This should be obtained via configuration. If this attribute can be obtained, this attribute MUST NOT be set ( `net.host.name` should be used instead).

**[3]:** some very long note that should be written under the semconv table

`faas.trigger` MUST be one of the following:

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `datasource` | A response to some data source operation such as a database or filesystem read/write. | Experimental |
| `http` | To provide an answer to an inbound HTTP request | Experimental |
| `pubsub` | A function is set to be executed when messages are sent to a messaging system. | Experimental |
| `timer` | A function is scheduled to be executed regularly. | Experimental |
| `other` | other | Experimental |
