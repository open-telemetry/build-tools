        These conventions can be used for http and https schemes

        brief: >
            Full HTTP request URL in the form `scheme://host[:port]/path?query[#fragment]`.
            Usually the fragment is not transmitted over HTTP, but if it is known, it should be included nevertheless.

            The value of the [HTTP host header](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.4).
            When the header is empty or not present, this attribute should be the same.

            This should be obtained via configuration.
            If this attribute can be obtained, this attribute MUST NOT be set ( `net.host.name` should be used instead).
        sampling_relevant: false
        brief: >
            The primary server name of the matched virtual host.
        note: >
            http.url is usually not readily available on the server side but would have to be assembled in a cumbersome and
            sometimes lossy process from other information (see e.g. open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python/pull/148).
            It is thus preferred to supply the raw data that is available.
        examples: ['example.com']
      - id: route
        type: string
        brief: >
            The matched route (path template).
        examples: '/users/:userID?'
      - id: client_ip
        type: string
        sampling_relevant: false
        brief: >
            The IP address of the original client behind all proxies, if
            known (e.g. from [X-Forwarded-For](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For)).
        note: >
            This is not necessarily the same as `net.peer.ip`, which would identify the network-level peer, which may be a proxy.
