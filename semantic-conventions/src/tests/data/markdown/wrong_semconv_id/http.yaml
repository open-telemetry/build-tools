        These conventions can be used for http and https schemes
        and various HTTP versions like 1.1, 2 and SPDY.

        type: string
        brief: >
            Full HTTP request URL in the form `scheme://host[:port]/path?query[#fragment]`.
            Usually the fragment is not transmitted over HTTP, but if it is known, it should be included nevertheless.

        brief: >
            The value of the [HTTP host header](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.4).
            When the header is empty or not present, this attribute should be the same.
        examples: ['www.example.org']

            This should be obtained via configuration.
            If this attribute can be obtained, this attribute MUST NOT be set ( `net.host.name` should be used instead).
        sampling_relevant: false
        brief: >
            The primary server name of the matched virtual host.
        note: >
            http.url is usually not readily available on the server side but would have to be assembled in a cumbersome and
            sometimes lossy process from other information (see e.g. open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python/pull/148).
            It is thus preferred to supply the raw data that is available.
        examples: ['example.com']
      - id: route
        type: string
        brief: >
            The matched route (path template).
        examples: '/users/:userID?'
      - id: client_ip
        type: string
        sampling_relevant: false
        brief: >
            The IP address of the original client behind all proxies, if
            known (e.g. from [X-Forwarded-For](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For)).
        note: >
            This is not necessarily the same as `net.peer.ip`, which would identify the network-level peer, which may be a proxy.
